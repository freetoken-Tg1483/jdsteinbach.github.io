It&#8217;s graduation season, so brace yourself! It&#8217;s time for all the &#8220;Follow Your Passion&trade;&#8221; posts. You&#8217;ll find most of these posts quoting Steve Jobs, assuming you have unlimited time/resources, and coming from positions of privilege. I went through a time where I soaked up these posts. I&#8217;m an Apple user, had no family (at that time), and am a straight white male, so BING-BING-BING &ndash; I was a perfect candidate to join the passion cult!

As appealing as &#8220;follow your passion&#8221; advice sounds (*Find a job you love and you&#8217;ll never work a day in your life,* amirite?), that way of looking at work left me more frustrated and discontent than anything else.

## Problems with &#8220;following your passion&#8221;

### I have a lot of passions!

### My passion isn&#8217;t worth money.

### My passions change really frequently&hellip;

## Some better advice&hellip;

### Focus on providing value to others.

### Make time for passions on the side.

### Plan to grow and change.
