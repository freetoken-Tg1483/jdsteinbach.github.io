I've seen a few other devs (like [Wes](https://wesbos.com/uses/) &amp; [Elijah](http://elijahmanor.com/uses/)) post about the tools they use and thought I'd share some details about my setup. Hopefully it's helpful to you!

## Software
* I write code in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I use the [Nord Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arcticicestudio.nord-visual-studio-code). I'm using the [San Francisco Mono font](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/).
* I don't do much design, but I love when designers hand off files in [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/). I've worked with [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) and it's not bad either.
* I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) for my terminal. I'm using [San Francisco Mono](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) there too, with [my own color scheme](https://gist.github.com/jdsteinbach/b57a5651b831d6161bbdd20396cfe33a#file-jdsteinbach-itermcolors). In iTerm, I use [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) with [my own custom prompt](https://gist.github.com/jdsteinbach/b57a5651b831d6161bbdd20396cfe33a#file-jdsteinbach-zsh-theme)
* I love [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) and have the Powerpack license.

## Physical
* I work from a MacBook Pro. When I'm home, it's hooked up to two external monitors: one portrait (for code and documents) and [one landscape](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XT7S2K3/).
* I use an adjustable garage work table. It looks a bit basic, but it's just what I need.
* I stand on a [Topo Anti-Fatigue Mat](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V3TO9HW/) by ErgoDriven. Sometimes I like to sit for a bit, and I bought a cheap [tall stool](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01K4D2K96/) for that.
* I like music, and listen to on [Pioneer SP-BS22-LR Bookshelf Speakers](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B008NCD2LG/) driven by [this amp](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B007TUSXEY/). I also use [AirPods Pro](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/) for calls/meetings and [Anker SoundCore Space NC headphones](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BBNS8N5/) when I need to block background noise more.
